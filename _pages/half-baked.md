if you don't know how to explain something plainly, you don't really understand it, and you won't have wide impact.  

when i don't understand the point someone is making, it's usually because they are:
1) intentionally making it unclear and shrouding the concept.
2) using complex words to elevate their perceived status or intelligence, which defeats the purpose of explanation.    
3) using too much field-specific terminology and not remembering what people don't know.

the jargon issue is something i'm guilty of myself, especially after i spend too much time in one information bubble. it's easy to start communicating in shortcuts when the fundamentals of a field (or social chamber) are assumed knowledge. those shortcut words are fine if you're speaking to others who share the same background, but if you want to broaden your audience and actually communicate, you have to meet them where they are. 

some concepts just have to be repeatedly introduced for them to stick. some of us were never properly introduced to terminology to begin with, and then we mangle the meaning.  

i'm not arguing against language or vocabulary. in fact, we should keep developing terms as our ideas become more cohesive. we have to name the thing before we can dialogue about the thing. that is fundamental to growth and deeper understanding. 

at the same time, we should push back against the constant stripping of meaning from words that describe important ideas. it might feel pointless to challenge someone who is intentionally contorting language... but they aren't always the real audience. spectators matter. third parties are an opportunity to teach.  

meet people where they are. if they don't understand, it won't make an impact. if it isn't accessible, it isn't revolutionary.

having a person you can rely on to share stuff with is awesome. but have you ever just made something exist and put it out there?  

nobody needs to give you permission, and not all feedback is valuable, actually.
