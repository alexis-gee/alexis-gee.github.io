sometimes i make stuff. 
  
sometimes i find stuff.  
  
sometimes i just want to write and expand on the ideas kicking around in my head.  
  
in a world driven by algorithms in walled off social silos and gatekept by the worst people imaginable, i'm aiming to reclaim my peace away from the noise with my own space to think.
