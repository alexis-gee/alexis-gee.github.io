I think less about whether the internet is “dead” and more about what fake interactions are doing to real people.  

Bots, generated content, and algorithmic amplification don’t just distort reality. They train behavior. Outrage gets rewarded. Performative dunking becomes normal. Escalation looks like participation.  

A lot of this didn’t even start organically. [Troll farms](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/media/2018/October/troll-farms-and-fake-news-social-media-weaponization) and other experimentation with [emotional engagement strategies](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1017/s0022381612000540) proved long ago that anger spreads faster than truth. Now those same dynamics are automated and scaled.  

The human vulnerabilities are predictable:
- emotional manipulation  
- othering of the [out-group](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8256037/)  
- [fear of standing out](https://aisel.aisnet.org/thci/vol17/iss2/2/)  
- [normalization through repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creeping_normality)  
- [fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_fatigue) and overstimulation  
- outsourcing thinking to loud, confident voices  

Every time I scroll past obvious fake content or check comments just to see if I’m losing my mind, I lose energy. Attention. [Decision-making capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue). That drain isn’t accidental.  

Most people don’t notice when it’s happening (or at least not until more recently). And it’s not because we’re stupid. [We’re all susceptible](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/07/430446/why-smart-people-fall-false-information-and-what-do-about-it) to manipulation, and it’s worse when we are [more burned out than ever](https://www.wcbu.org/local-news/2024-10-01/american-workers-are-burning-out-in-what-experts-call-a-great-exhaustion).  

Resisting this isn’t about being “smarter.” It’s about slowing down, noticing when something is trying to provoke you, and choosing not to perform on command. For some of us it might mean abstaining completely. But the odds are stacked against us when those who control our communication platforms benefit from our perpetual scrolling. Social media platforms are designed to keep us trapped in them. We are their product. They want to control us.  

The harder question now, though, isn’t just *what’s wrong with the internet*.  

It’s *how do we change things?*
