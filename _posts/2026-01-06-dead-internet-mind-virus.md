I think less about whether the internet is “dead” and more about what fake interactions are doing to real people. Bots, generated content, and algorithmic amplification don’t just distort reality. They train behavior. Outrage gets rewarded, and performative dunking becomes normal. Escalation is made to look like participation.

A lot of this didn’t even start organically. [Troll farms](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/media/2018/October/troll-farms-and-fake-news-social-media-weaponization) and experiments with [emotional engagement](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1017/s0022381612000540) proved long ago that [anger spreads faster than joy](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160803656F/abstract) and [falsehoods faster than truth](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-false-news-spreads-faster-truth). Now those same dynamics are automated and scaled.

The human vulnerabilities are predictable:
- emotional manipulation  
- othering of the [out-group](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8256037/)  
- [fear of standing out](https://aisel.aisnet.org/thci/vol17/iss2/2/)  
- [normalization through repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creeping_normality)  
- [fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_fatigue) and overstimulation  
- outsourcing thinking to loud, confident voices  

Every time I scroll past obvious fake content or check comments just to see if I’m losing my mind, I lose energy, attention, and [decision-making capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue). That drain isn’t accidental.

Most people don’t notice when it’s happening (or at least not until more recently). [We’re all susceptible](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/07/430446/why-smart-people-fall-false-information-and-what-do-about-it) to manipulation and [addiction](https://www.addictioncenter.com/behavioral-addictions/social-media-addiction/) to this stuff, and it’s worse when we are [more burned out than ever](https://www.wcbu.org/local-news/2024-10-01/american-workers-are-burning-out-in-what-experts-call-a-great-exhaustion).

Resisting this isn’t about being “smarter.” We could notice when we are being provoked and choose not to perform on command. But that places responsibility solely on the individual user. In addition to AI-enhanced actors that are trying to influence us, these platforms are designed to extract attention at scale. The odds are stacked against us when those who control our communication platforms benefit from our perpetual scrolling. We are their product.

There are a lot of hard questions that we *really* need to sit with and stop ignoring. We are way beyond just asking *what’s wrong with the internet*.

We’ve reached *how do we fix this?* Do we continue to allow unaccountable manipulation for profit?
